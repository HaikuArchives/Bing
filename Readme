Welcome to the Bing "ReadMe" file!

Bing is a crazy pong clone that uses windows to draw the game
elements. It is very cool-looking, and very CPU-intensive.
I wrote it as a week-end hack in september '98, and it didn't really
change since then.

The controls are :
left player: A,Z (A,Y on a German Keyboard, Q,W on a French one)
right player: up and down arrow
start a new game : space bar

Revision history :

0.4b2 : compile it for R5.0.3. tweak the makefile a bit.
0.4 : massive source cleanup. support window de-activation
0.3 : source cleanup. compiled for R4.5
0.2 : fixed keys. added random serve
0.1 : first release

Todo (in no particular order) :

[DONE]computer player
preference panel (keys, colors, difficulty)
better handling of ffm
make it handle low resolutions (640x480, 800x600) more gracefully
use asynchronous controls w/ unmapped keys
better handling of floating windows
adaptative level
demo mode
investigate why it doesn't work with the most aggressive optimization levels
more code cleanup
